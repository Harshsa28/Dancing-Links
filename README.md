# Dancing-Links
Dancing Links + Algorithm X (DLX Algorithm, by Donald Knuth) implemented in Python
The DLX algorithm is first implemented for 4x4 sudoku puzzles
And then it is also implemented for 9x9 sudoku puzzles
Basically it creates a (9x9x9) x (9x9x4) = 729 x 324 matrix for 0s and 1s
The matrix represents a Exact Cover problem
Which is then very efficiently solved using Donald Knuth's DLX Algorithm
The output is given showing which numbers to add in which cells.
I plan on improving this further to give faster results.
